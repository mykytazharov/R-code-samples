## Owerview

In this project I would like to show how the leaflet package for R can be used to show an interective map with markers, visualising data. 

Let us start by loading the leaflet package.

```{r }
library(leaflet)
```

I would like to visualise the city of Aachen and create a marker for RWTH Aachen University Main Building.

```{r }
my_map <-leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        setView(lng = 6.083611, lat = 50.775555, zoom = 15) %>%
        addMarkers(popup = "RWTH Aachen University Main Building", 
                   lng = 6.077686, 
                   lat = 50.777923, label = "RWTH Aachen University")

my_map
```
